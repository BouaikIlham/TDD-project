# TDD Project

> In this project we implemented a class with some methods, but we did it by doing test-driven development (TDD). The idea was to write tests first and then the code.


## Technologies used:

- Ruby
- Rspec

## Getting Started

- clone the repository by running
  git clone `https://github.com/BouaikIlham/TDD-project.git`
- navigate to the folder
  cd `TDD-project`
